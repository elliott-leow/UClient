# Kabbalah Client

A utility mod aimed at aiding players in Hypixel's "The Bridge" minigame. This mod is **bannable** on hypixel, but I do not care as this mod will not get you banned unless you lack brain cells. The developer of this client is not responsible if you get banned from servers because of this mod. This mod includes features such as Auto Dodge and Double Clicker. 

## Getting Started

Currently, you can only build this yourself. However, a releases tab will be added in the future.

### Prerequisites

You will need forge 1.8.9 to run this mod.

### Installing

This is a forge mod, a tab for releases will be added eventually. To install this mod, have forge installed and drag the jar file into the mods folder.
